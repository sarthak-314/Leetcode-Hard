#Problem : Minimize cost to paint houses. Houses can be painted only once. 
#Given num_neighbors, make the target neighbors while minimizeing cost

#Problem Pattern : Minimize a value give a condition
#Possible Solutions : Dynamic Programming, Brute Force DFS

#DP State - ith house, neighbors_rem, prev_house_color
#Time Complexity - O( N * K * C ) | N houses, K target_neighbors, C colors

#Better Time Complexity - M c T * N! with backtracking

#Top Down DP
