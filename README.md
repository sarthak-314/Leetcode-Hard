This repo contains my solutions to Leetcode Hard questions from 946 - 1500.
It starts from 946 because I've already solved hard label questions from 1 - 945 in the past year. 
Also contains Hackkerrank hard, after I ran out of Leetcode Hard
I skip a question if : 
1. It requires Leetcode premium membership.
2. Like to dislike ratio is less than 2 (too many dislikes).
3. Uses some obscure algorithm / Data structure.
4. it is easy / way too hard. 

My main focus with this repo is to practice approaching an algorithmic problem. Once I have a solution in mind, I find it easy to convert it to code. It's usually the 'getting to the solution' part I struggle with. 
There is no bug free code that coveres all the edge cases, but mathematical part. 
I don't wanna spend half my time debugging. 

I get enough practice with debugging in competetive programming and project development. So i skip this part because it's boring and I hate it. Also i don't learn as much as I would when grinding math shit.
TODO: Clean the read me, man.

M for metasolving where instead of solving the problem with code, I'm solving on how to come up with the code.
